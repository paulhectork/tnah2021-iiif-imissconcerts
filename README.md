[jfobzb](20200225_jfo-bazrabal_cover.png)

## This manifest contains:
- 9 pictures of noise concerts (both of live performances and setup pictures) uploaded to archive.org
- annotations for all pictures
- a search API

## About the data and annotations
- all pictures have been taken by the author, with authorization of the musicians.
- the content of the annotations (including quotes from musicians) is derived of research made for my master's thesis, which focused on noise instrumentation, studied from an ethnomusicological viewpoint.

This IIIF mannifest was created using the IIIF Training Workbench and annoted using the SimpleAnnotationServer, created by the IIIF organization.
